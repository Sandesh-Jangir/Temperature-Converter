# Temperature-Converter
It is a C++ program that fetches the temperature in celcius and then converts it in the requested temprature scale.

### Input-Output Interface 
- It first takes the conversion method sno. as a input to choose the conversion method.
- Then it takes the input in degree celcius.
- Finally send a output message that `The Temperature in <requested format> is : <output>`.

### Functions
- `float c_to_k(float)` for converting into **deg. Kelvin**
- `float c_to_f(float)` for converting into **deg. Fahrenite**
